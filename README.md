Description
=============

#### - Graph processing methods
  - NetworkX: a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks
  - Building node features for graph or node classificatioin: in graph classification problem, what kind of node features use is influential for classification performance
  - Graph subsampling: removing node or edge randomly to subsampling and augmentation of graph dataset 
  
#### - Upload code as the Jupiter Notebook file (.ipynb) for intuitive understanding
